After all training done, 131 target PSMs with q<0.0100 were found when measuring on the test set
Found 131 target PSMs scoring over 1.0000% FDR level on testset
Less identifications (131 vs 165) after percolator processing than before processing
Reseting score vector, using default vector
Selected feature number 24 as initial search direction, could separate 110 positives in that direction
Selected feature number 24 as initial search direction, could separate 108 positives in that direction
Selected feature number 24 as initial search direction, could separate 115 positives in that direction
